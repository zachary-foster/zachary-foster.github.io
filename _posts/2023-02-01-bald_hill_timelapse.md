After dealing with some medical problems recently, I have been trying to get outside more to experience the views and get some exercise.
For the past few years I have enjoyed visiting the numerous parks and forests around Corvalis after work and taking pictures, so I am tyring to get back into that regardless of the short and cold days.
Today I road my electric bike up to the top of Bald Hill and set up the tripod for a long-exposure timelapse for the city below.
The half-frozen mud made the ride up the hill a bit challenging, but it was well worth it for the view.
I have done this a few times and its always surprising how timeplase videos make the already beautiful view of city lights in the valley so much more interesting.
When combined with banks of flowing fog, moving clouds, or spinning starscapes, it can make for some truly mesmerizing video.
This time however there was an blank overcast sky and little fog, so I would like to get back out there soon an try a longer video under more dynamic conditions.

This video is made from 622 images taken every 4 seconds and converted into a movie using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).
Although the video appears to move, it is acutally a moving crop of a set of larger images like the one below.
I am considering making a tutorial for how to do these kind of shots and convert the images to moving timeplase videos.
